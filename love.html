      <h3>Forever My Valentine</h3>

      <p>
        In your eyes, I found my home, A gentle warmth I’ve always known. <br />
        Your smile turns my fears to light, My darkest days feel soft and
        bright.
        <br />

        Your laughter heals my quiet pain, Like sunshine after falling rain.
        <br />
        With every breath, my heart does say, “I choose you more with every
        day.” <br />

        Through every storm and peaceful shore, I’ll love you deeper, more and
        more. <br />
        My soul is yours, my heart, my mind— In you, my forever love I find.
        <br />

        So on this day of hearts and signs, I give you all of me as mine <br />
        Not just today, but all my life— Forever yours, my Valentine.
      </p>
